# Simple Pendulum
This folder contains files for solving the problem of the simple pendulum, where &theta; is the angle from the positive x axis. 

## Dependencies
The `simple-pendulum.cpp` program has a dependency on the following binaries being in one's path:

* gnuplot
* rsvg-convert

the Makefile also requires the `time` binary to be in the system PATH. time should come pre-installed with most Linux distributions.
